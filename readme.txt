# KamenoÅ¾rout game available at https://is.muni.cz/auth/hry/01/

# update:
# rn, implementing the rest of GUI (part still available, follow steps below)
#	and working on structuring the project a bit better
# studying PostgreSQL, hopefully to be used here soon

# note that the code might differ from the requirements in the other files;
# 	this app went through some changes after the initial submition

# also note that the app is not as polished as i would like it to be
# 	the Board.solve() fctions overhead could be dramatically reduced...
#	not all edge cases are handled properly...
#	UI needs a lot of work...
#	saving user credentials in pt is obviously a big no-no...
# 	and lots of more...
# but i believe, that this version still presents the general idea quite well
# and since i want to release this version asap, this will have to do for now


# now, i will take you through the app so that you get the general idea on what
# it is useful for, feel free to look around whenever you feel like it

# start the app; this is what you should see on the console
